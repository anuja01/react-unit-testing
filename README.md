This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Notes

Jest is by default available with `create-react-app` boilerplate.   

`import "@testing-library/jest-dom"` - jest-dom is required to execute `expect()` statements.   

`describe` is used to organize tests into groups.   

Snapshot tests are a very useful tool whenever you want to make sure your UI does not change unexpectedly.
